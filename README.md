## Process

 I used CSS Grid for the core of the layout. 
It changes from a one column layout on small screens 
to a three-part column on larger screens. The auto 
top and bottom margins have kept in in the middle. 

*I've also used position: relative on the cards
so I can position the image absolutely.*

## What I learned

That I can center a container vertically within the 
context of a grid container using auto margins. 


## Future Improvements

I need to learn how to get to get the box-shadow 
perfectly even on a card even when it has border-radius.
